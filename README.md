Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

*The project that was created was for the client "The Gaming Room". They currently have a game application called "Draw It Or Lose It", this game was only created for Android systems. The client was inteseted in expanding their user base by putting their game on more traditional platforms like Windows and Mac. They are also inteseted in translating the game to more moble platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

*I think that I work really hard in getting all or my research complied and getting in done in the small amount of time I had to work on the project.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

*Having the design document help me see how the code should be set up and helped me walked through the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

*I think that I would revise my design constraints part of the documents. I would like to go into more detail about the certain contraints that might occur.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

*It is very important to consider the user when designing. The user is the one using the program more often than the designer, so getting their feedback on how to make things better would just improve the game more than hinder it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

*I followed the requirements from the modules to help me in designing the software. The modules helped break this down step by step and by making this into smaller portions helped me more on things with better accuracy. I will continue to use this in the future.
